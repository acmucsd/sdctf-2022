Make an av that reads input (stdin) from Unix domain socket

input is a list of files to be scanned, every line one file

OUTPUT:
ok/fail

If fail, need to see AV log for why


Scanning a file `f`:

1. check if `f` is owned by user (abort otherwise)
2. COPY (insecurely, following symlinks) f to /tmp/sham-av-xxxxxxxxxxxx where x is the SHA256 hash from a secret counter nonce
3. CHMOD /tmp/sham-av-xxxxxxxxxxxx so that it is readable by the user (since it is originally owned by the user anyways)
4. Compute SHA256 of /tmp/sham-av-xxxxxxxxxxxx, if it is malicious (matches malicious list), delete the original file and say the file is quarantined at /tmp/sham-av-xxxxxxxxxxxx


MAKE sure the flag has no read bit (even when owned by av) and require a manual read-flag.sh file to read the flag (which does chmod +r first)


Vulnerability include arbitrary file read from source symlink, and arbitrary file write from destination symlink

extended format (likely will not used):

INPUT:

command code,
argument1,
argument2,
...
