### prompt
My friend sent me the flag, but its encrypted!
I heard them yell something about six bites...but I donâ€™t understand what they mean!

The ciphertext: `kwsbqhS}_aYLH_!WYg+kDIV0yp[k`

Can you decrypt the flag?

### original specification
By using the knowledge that the key size is six bytes, players will hopefully conclude they will have to perform a XOR known-plaintext attack, with their knowledge of the first six characters of the flag sdctf{. They can use CyberChef to discover what key produces sdctf{, then copy those bytes back in as the key to decrypt the entire flag.

**flag:** `sdctf{KnOwN_PL1ANt3xT_A#acK}`
