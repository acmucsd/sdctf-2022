### prompt
An oracle is a black box in a Turing machine. You can run it but how do you inspect it?

### original specification
This is an easy Java reversing challenge. Oracle is a reference to Java's author company. Solvable with something like JD (Java Decompiler) or IntelliJâ€™s built-in decompiler.
