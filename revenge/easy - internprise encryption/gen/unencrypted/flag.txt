Hey Dave,
I went to a fortune teller the other day and while she divined my future, she mentioned you, strangely enough. 
I don't know why you came up if it was *my* fortune that was being read, but she said something about "your coworker Dave"
and a "grave mistake," but I didn't read too much into it. She told me to send you this though: 
	sdctf{D0n't_b3_a_D4v3_ju5t_Use_AES_0r_S0me7h1ng}
I'm not sure why she wanted you to know this gibberish. I can't seem to make heads or tails of it.
Anyways are you coming to the company picnic this Saturday? I heard Carol from HR is bringing some of her world-famous 
deviled eggs.

Best, 
Jared from Accounting
