### prompt
My friend Susan is having a photo album party, but she accidentally corrupted the SD card with all her photos on it! Can you save Susan's party by recovering her photos?

### original specification
Simple recover-the-JPEGs from the SD card image challenge. Automated tools to handle this exist, but you can also write a script to do it in about 5 minutes.

if you want to know what the title is a reference to, just google it
