### prompt
The new ultra maximum security plugin I installed on my website is so good that even I can’t log in. Hackers don’t stand a chance.

### original specification
A simple web app with a login that is visible in the HTML. You'll be given a JWT token that lets you access the site content, but it expires in 2 seconds. When you log in, a flag link becomes visible that leads to the /s route. If the user managed to access that route quick enough, they would be taken to a page that has the letter d on it. If they made a request to /s/d they would receive the next letter of the flag until it's spelled out in the website path. This challenge can be solved by using automated scripts that post the login url and visit the next part of the path and generate tokens quickly enough to get 

**flag:** `sdctf{Th3_m0r3_t0k3ns_the_le55_pr0bl3ms_adf3d}`
