### prompt
Sometimes I worry about my friend... he's way too into memes, he's always smiling, and he's always spouting nonsense about some "forbidden app."
I don't know what he's talking about, but maybe you can help me figure it out!
All I know is that at one point he went by the username DanFlashes way back in the day. Good luck! Flag format is `sdctf{flag}`

### original specification
A simple two-note challenge: finding the correct social media from an indirect description and finding an old account on waybackmachine  

**flag:** `sdctf{morning_noon_and_night_I_meme}`
