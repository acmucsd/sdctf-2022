### prompt
Oh no! A hacker has stolen a flag from us and is holding it ransom.

Can you help us figure out who created this document? Find their email address and demand they return the flag!

### original specification
Basically you just need to use https://github.com/Malfrats/xeuledoc and it will tell you the email address of the account that owns the document. Emailing the address will autorespond with the flag.

**flag:** `sdctf{0p3n_S0uRCE_1S_aMaz1NG}`
